[Kivy](https://www.kivy.org) is an open-source [Python](https://python.org) framework
for developing GUI apps that work cross-platform, including desktop, mobile and
embedded platforms.

It comes with a demo that shows how to code a simple game of
[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

This repository is a demonstration of how to package the game, so it can be
built for a number of platforms.
